I've never used XNA before, but this project has kinda given me a foundation to learn it on. If this project isn't under construction anymore, can I submit patches or anything for it? I'd love to develop and add my own features. I understand that this is only an engine and not a full fledged game, but there are a lot of things this engine could use (finite/infinite water switch, a block ID system or a way of adding new blocks from the game project instead of the engine project (there may already be a way to do this that I haven't found), more controls such as crouching and sprinting, non-infinite jumping, etc). If you would, please reply! Thanks!\r<br />\n<br />\n~ Blake<br />\n",
