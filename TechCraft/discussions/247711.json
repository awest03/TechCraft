This of course negated the \"Q\" and \"E\" keys but I am ok with that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lets see, also added a bunch of new sounds and some logic to determine what block plays what sound.<br />I got rid of the bazooka. Nice... but not the effect I am going for :-P</p>\r\n<p>Now please guys, dont be to critical of my coding skills. Im a vb guy. Started coding 20 years ago in QB, and been a basic coder ever scince then. <br />I know enough about c# to be dangerous but this is my first full fledge dive into c# so if you see a lot of newbie mistakes forgive me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On another note. Anyway to invoke the lighting? When you encapsulate yourself in blocks it should be dark. But it is not. I tried the Lighting.Update method as blocks are added and or removed but that was kinda stupid as I think thats already been invoked.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>bamyazi, I have seen the isUnderwater flag. I will give that swimming thing a shot. Thanks :)</p>",
