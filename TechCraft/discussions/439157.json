When I break the flowers that cause light, then only thing that happens is the other flowers change color and the light from the flower you broke does not go away.\r<br />\n<br />\nI was wondering if this is a bug or if I managed to break something while rummaging through the code. \r<br />\n<br />\nI have the most &quot;recent&quot; download of New Take, from April 2012.<br />\n",
