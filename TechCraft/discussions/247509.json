Myself I&nbsp;prefer mercurial, just for the ability to do local commits on my laptop offline and push the changesets to the repository later. The advanced branching / merging of forks is interesting too for an experimental opensource project.</p>\n<p>For enabling mercurial instead of svn we just need&nbsp;to ask the codeplex support ...&nbsp;</p>",
