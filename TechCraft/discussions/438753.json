However, the demo project is not using this. \r<br />\nIs there a simple was to &quot;enable&quot; the infinite generation or do I need to reverse engineer the engine and implement that functionality?\r<br />\n<br />\nI've had a look at voxeliq too....which has the Infinite functionality implemented by default, but unfortunately, voxeliq apparently is not updated anymore and has some bad issues with some broken voxels, so I wanted to get back to Techcraft instead! :)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot in advance for your feedback!<br />\n",
