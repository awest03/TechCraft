I'm progressing a lot and wanted to share few assets here.</p>\r\n<p>First of all, I got inspired by techcraft engine a lot though my codebase is completely different then techcraft (and I remember contributing to a few tiny features to techcraft from my codebase - like flatten array technique)</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I've taken huge progress with my engine and now even techniques used differs from techcraft a lot. Techcraft is using array of blocks per chunks (which my engine was also using it for a long while) though I've now changed it to a single huge block\r\n array. And this led to great optimizations. If you want to technical reasons behind, I'm blogging about them on my dev-blog over\r\n<a href=\"http://www.voxeliq.org/\">http://www.voxeliq.org/</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Youtube:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/voxeliq\">http://www.youtube.com/voxeliq</a>\r\n</li><li>Dev-Blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.voxeliq.org/\">http://www.voxeliq.org/</a> </li></ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/raistlinthewiz/voxeliq\">https://github.com/raistlinthewiz/voxeliq</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"https://voxeliq.codeplex.com/\">https://voxeliq.codeplex.com/</a> </li></ul>\r\n<p>Anyway here's a few videos and screenshots from current revision;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screenshot: </strong><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cZCTt.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/voxeliq\">http://www.youtube.com/voxeliq</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Status</strong></p>\r\n<p>The engine is closed source right now and I'm still not sure if I'll go open source one day. Still I'm looking for people interested in to help the project, artist, music composers or even developers so we may go for an indie game using it. Message me please\r\n if you're interested.</p>\r\n",
