There s no executable released, the source is really in a pre-alpha state,&nbsp;sorry.</p>\r\n<p>And there s no gameplay by the way, just an engine : even building something in the world would be a big waste of time, the world is not saved to disk currently.</p>\r\n<p>Follow the project , there will be a demo executable release one day, cant say when. could be weeks or months. Or could be tomorrow if someone makes it on his own fork ;)</p>",
