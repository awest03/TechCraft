Need to add Persistence methods, to be able to Save / Load maps.</span>\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.Exit, Keys.Escape);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.FreeCam, Keys.F1);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;MouseButtons&gt;(DebugActions.ToggleFullScreen, MouseButtons.MiddleButton);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.FixedTimeStepPlusVSync, Keys.F3);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.DayMode, Keys.F9);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.NightMode, Keys.F10);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.ToggleRasterMode, Keys.F4);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.DiagnosticMode, Keys.F8);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.ReleaseMouse, Keys.F);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.ShowMinimap, Keys.M);\r\n            inputState.Mapping.SetMappedValue&lt;Keys&gt;(DebugActions.StealthMode, Keys.S);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I would also like to look at putting together a UI for the user to Create / Edit / Load / Save Mappings - so the benefits of having a mapping can actually be realised.</p>\r\n<p>Is this of interest to you?</p>\r\n",
