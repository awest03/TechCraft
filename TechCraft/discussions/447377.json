Thank you for the source code, it is very helpful, but I do wish there were more comments!\r<br />\n<br />\nSo... Could someone show me what class/method or effect applies the textures while drawing? Please and thank you very much!<br />\n",

    "Html": "Unfortunately Im still learning the code myself (and the details of XNA/c#)... but first thing - depends on whether you are looking at the NewTake (newer but not finished) code or the TechCraft code (older but more complete).<br />\n<br />\nTechCraft:  I think the textures are assigned via the Effects parameters.  Have a look at the line as follows in TechCraft4.0Engine\\WorldEngine\\World.cs:<br />\n<pre><code>_solidBlockEffect.Parameters[&quot;BlockTexture&quot;].SetValue(_textureAtlas);</code></pre>\n\n(the _textureAtlas is a texture containing the spritesheet of blocks)<br />\n<br />\nVery similar (AFAIK) in NewTake, except that the code is in NewTake\\view\\Renderers\\SimpleRenderer.cs:<br />\n<pre><code>_solidBlockEffect.Parameters[&quot;Texture1&quot;].SetValue(_textureAtlas);</code></pre>\n\nAnd getting beyond that - to the effects files themselves (SolidBlockEffect.fx), is getting beyond me to understand properly at this point...<br />\n<br />\nSomeone kindly correct me if I'm wrong? :)<br />\n",
