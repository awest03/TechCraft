    "Description": "<@BamYazi> re. occlusion culling - slaihne uses 6 vertex buffers per chunk - one per each face direction, then each frame you only submit the vertex buffers for visible faces. \r\nI can see this working on PC's, but the reason i went for a single vertex buffer in original techcraft is\r\n that the XBOX sucks for draw calls but has a massive fill rate so overdraw or culling is faster on the GPU.\r\n I wouldn't bother at the moment but once the\r\nBuild/Generate stuff is in place it would be straight forward to do a renderer which uses this technique\r\n",
