    "Description": "<raistlinthewiz> i've a suggestion on your chunk-renderer Y-optimization\r\n<raistlinthewiz> though still not tested\r\n<raistlinthewiz> so as of right now for a given chunk it finds top-solid block and lowest-emtpy-block offset right?\r\n<raistlinthewiz> and then chunk renderer iterates through max_offset to bottom\r\n<raistlinthewiz> so it basically ignores all the vertice stuff for empty-blocks at the top (air)\r\n<@enomi> bottom = lowest empty -1 so ignore invisible ground blocks\r\n<raistlinthewiz> what i'm thinking of is coming with a byte TopSolidBlocks[,] array where for each given x-z pair, i'll storing the top-solid-offset value for the given column\r\n<raistlinthewiz> it uses 256 bytes for each chunks and given a 30 x 30 world it ll be only consuming 200kbs\r\n<raistlinthewiz> so when iterating the chunk renderer's loop, i'll be iterating for each x-z pair's top-y-offset to bottom\r\n<@enomi> i understand\r\n<raistlinthewiz> though this will not work for bottom values\r\n<raistlinthewiz> for bottom offsets we still need a common offset value common for the chunk\r\n<@enomi> im sensing it could get us to column occlusion culling like in the university paper i linked you ...\r\n<raistlinthewiz> i've not read the paper yet but will be..\r\n<@enomi> i was thinking about limiting x and z loops too, would optimize cliffs and holes. but all this could hinder the terrain gen perf, which is not a big problem cause it ll eventually be stored on disk\r\n<raistlinthewiz> though margin should not be so big that would introduce performance problems when the terrain is initially generated by inf-world\r\n",
